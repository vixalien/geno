Deno bindings for GObject. not yet ready. to use:

1. Install Deno from https://deno.land/#installation
2. Build the necessary libraries manually by running `./build_structs.bash` in `native`.
3. Run the example file: `deno run -A --unstable ./example/ascii_strup.ts`

note that the `--unstable` flag is required as direct FFI is still unstable in deno.

improvements are welcome.
