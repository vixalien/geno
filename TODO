- export the GI_IS_STRUCT_INFO fucntions to JSX
- auto convert baseinfo to relevant types
- find a way to deal with flags
- normalize getters vs. get_[property]
- return null for properties that return that (check pointer value)
- specifically convert int/number types (I'm still confused about whether i64 maps to number or bigint)
- add a static property that checks the type of a baseinfo
- add a static property that automatically maps a pointer to the correct struct
